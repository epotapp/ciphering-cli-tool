# Ciphering CLI Tool

**This CLI-tool helps encrypt a text in three ways.**

CLI tool should accept 3 options (short alias and full name):

    -c, --config: config for ciphers Config is a string with pattern {XY(-)}n, where:

    X is a cipher mark:
        C is for Caesar cipher (with shift 1)
        A is for Atbash cipher
        R is for ROT-8 cipher
    Y is flag of encoding or decoding (mandatory for Caesar cipher and ROT-8 cipher and should not be passed Atbash cipher)
        1 is for encoding
        0 is for decoding

    -i, --input: a path to input file
    -o, --output: a path to output file

For example, config "C1-C1-R0-A" means "encode by Caesar cipher => encode by Caesar cipher => decode by ROT-8 => use Atbash"

The original text should be in the **input.txt** file. The ciphertext must be in a file called **output.txt**.
If these files are missing, input or outbut uses the terminal.

Caesar's cipher shifts the alphabet 1 letter forward. 
Rot8, respectively, 8 letters forward. 
Atbash unfolds the alphabet in a mirror image.

**Please write a command based on example of:**  

**"node index.js -c C1-A-R1 -i input.txt -o output.txt"**
